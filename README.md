# ⏪ Rewind for Android

⛔️ Entering the Danger Zone ⛔️

This code is not at all cleaned up and was just a prototype to mess around with some APIs and UI techniques.
So... proceed with caution.

### Details
This was a fun project to explore some Android APIs and try and rebuild the timeline view from [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/).

It's built with:
- ComposeUI for the timeline view
- PackageManager to get installed apps metadata
- UsageStatsManager to get app usage details
